  description: 'Creating a tool to build and manage design systems that scale with your company\'s vision.'
}

Over the past few years, I've been working on design systems for myself and a few other companies and projects. Throughout my development process I've noticed key components and traits that I've found myself using time and time again to build and manage these systems. Despite companies having different visions and goals, these components and traits are always in-line with whatever vision the company has. After extracting these components and traits, it led to the creation of a tool to build and manage design systems that scale with your company's vision called Sentro.

## Introducing Sentro
Sentro is a low-level SCSS library for building and managing token-driven design systems. It provides the functionality to create and manage tokens, themes, keys, breakpoints, etc. It is designed to be framework-agnostic, to create an API right out of the box as you shape your design system, and it is based on the usage of design tokens.

Sentro is built using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), as I wanted it to be closer to CSS more than anything. Despite wanting a more minimal approach, avoiding the hassle of setting up build scripts and steps, this is the closest I can try to get to it: one build command, and one peer dependency.

### Architecture
Sentro is designed to be your design system's foundation. It provides the functionality to create and manage tokens, themes, keys, breakpoints, etc. Its conventions with how you consume and manage tokens can be used directly.

<div className="mx-auto my-lg" style={{ maxWidth: '540px' }}>
  <PreviewImage src="/img/blog/creating-sentro/heirarchy-slim.png" alt="Sentro as your core library." />
</div>

You can also try adding another abstraction layer to extend Sentro. Common patterns to color, struct, typography, etc. can be made into functions and mixins to ease the development of the design system. This allows you to create your own conventions and patterns on top of Sentro, enabling you to create your own portable core library.

<div className="mx-auto my-lg" style={{ maxWidth: '540px' }}>
  <PreviewImage src="/img/blog/creating-sentro/heirarchy.png" alt="Sentro as your foundation for the core library." />
</div>

Additionally, Sentro does not enforce any specific design pattern apart from its opinion on token management and consumption. All terminologies of functions and mixins are left to the developer to decide. This allows for a more flexible and customizable design system; more fit to the overall vision of the product and company.
