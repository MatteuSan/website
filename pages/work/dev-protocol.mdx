Dev Protocol is a solution for sustainability issues of creators activities, it is designed for the blockchain solution and enhance creators to grow their economy. During my time with the company we've made a lot of significant improvements with how they handle user interfaces.

My time at the company gave birth to their design system, [Hashi](/tools/hashi). With its implementation, the new unified design language now spans across multiple products in the ecosystem. It also laid the foundation for their numerous products including [Niwa](https://niwa.xyz), [Clubs](https://clubs.place), and their main website.

Hashi unified the experience across their productsâ€”all while keeping the identity of each project unique. Making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the Dev Protocol Ecosystem, and it made significant improvements in the time it takes to develop and ship new features.

### Hashi
Hashi is Dev Protocol's design system. Aiming to bring a unified user experience when using Dev Protocol products, to present an elegant user interface for consumers to interact with, and to be able to create the same user interfaces regardless of any frontend framework. It powers most of the experiences in the Dev Protocol ecosystem including but not limited to: the [Dev Protocol website](https://devprotocol.xyz), [Clubs](https://clubs.place), [Niwa](https://niwa.xyz), and many more products.

It boasts a wide range of utilities, scalable component architecture, great API and developer experience, and the ability to scale the design system based on the product's own design needs. It gives you the ability to customize the global and component-level themes, create layouts, build specialized components and layouts, and more without compromise.
