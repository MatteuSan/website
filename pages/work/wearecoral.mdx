Coral is an innovative crowdfunding platform dedicated to nurturing the musicians and scenes we love. Monthly pledges are dispersed among various musicians through user-led allocation models, creating meaningful impact not only for individual artists but also within the music communities we're passionate about.

### What did I do?
I designed and implemented the conversion pages. The experience was carefully crafted, so it takes the users on a journey from the surface to the thriving ecosystem of corals below. The pages were designed to be responsive, accessible, beautiful, and delightful to use.

I've also made improvements to the onboarding flows, modal UIs, and overall platform experience.
