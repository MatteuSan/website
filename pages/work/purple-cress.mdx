Purple Cress was a Japanese manga scanlation group. Their scanlation work is diverse. From one-shots, to short form series, to the larger serialized series. It boasts an in-house built manga reader with basic accessibility features, a beautiful UI to navigate the scanlation's portfolio, and an admin panel to manage the content published.
