INM Audio is one of the Philippine's leading brands when it comes in custom in-ear monitors. Their clients range from the average audiophile seeking a unique tuning, to professionals working on the stage or in the studio. They offer a wide range of products and services, from custom in-ear monitors, to ear impressions, to repairs and maintenance. The company is based in Meycauayan, Bulacan and has been in the industry since 2019.

They've tasked me to make a webapp that would help them streamline the first half of the ordering process (choosing the model, and designing the IEM) and make it more engaging and personal to the end-user.

## Goals
Right from the start, the client had a clear goal in mind: to make the ordering process more engaging and personalized. As a manufacturer of custom in-ear monitors, they want potential customers to experience the ordering process to mimic the feeling of ordering a product in real life. On my side, this meant I had to make the experience of ordering feel alive and be as close to what the user's end product would be like in the real world.

## Challenges
One of the biggest challenges I faced in this project was the rendering of the 3D model. Granted, computer-generated imagery won't ever be as realistic as real life. However, strives in the industry have been made to get thereâ€”and if I'm being honest, we're getting close.
