INM Audio is one of the Philippine's leading brands when it comes in custom in-ear monitors. Their clients range from the average audiophile seeking a unique tuning, to professionals working on the stage or in the studio. They offer a wide range of products and services, from custom in-ear monitors, to ear impressions, to repairs and maintenance. The company is based in Meycauayan, Bulacan and has been in the industry since 2019.

In 2024, they've tasked me to make a webapp that would help them streamline the first half of the ordering process (choosing the model, and designing the IEM) and make it more engaging and personal to the end-user. This increased their web presence, increased traffic, and allowed them to reach more customers while also providing a more convenient way for their customers to order their products from anywhere in the world.
