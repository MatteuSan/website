INM Audio is one of the Philippine's leading brands when it comes in custom in-ear monitors. Their clients range from the average audiophile seeking a unique tuning, to professionals working on the stage or in the studio. They offer a wide range of products and services, from custom in-ear monitors, to ear impressions, to repairs and maintenance. The company is based in Meycauayan, Bulacan and has been in the industry since 2019.

They've tasked me to make a webapp that would help them streamline the first half of the ordering process (choosing the model, and designing the IEM) and make it more engaging and personal to the end-user. The webapp was built using React, Three, and SCSS.
